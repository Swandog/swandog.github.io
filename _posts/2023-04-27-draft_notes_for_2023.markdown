**EDITOR'S NOTES:** I wanted to jot down some thoughts on da Bears, right as the draft starts, mainly so I can go back to this page and yell "I SAID SO" if it turns out I was right. Turns out I'm not fast enough, and I didn't get it finished until after Indianapolis took the #4 pick. But most of this still holds.

# How I would feel about moves in the first round

## Moves that would make me feel excellent

### Trade down and draft Darnell Wright, OT Tennessee

Going into 2023, even after free agency, the Bears still have a lot of needs. And they won't be a good team unless they fill all of them. So it's tempting to say that they can go in a lot of directions. But I think that's wrong. Because it's very likely that, if they try to fill all their needs, they will fail at one. So, the question becomes, are there any where failure isn't so bad, and are there any were failure is catastrophic. And I have a strong opinion:

The Bears MUST roll out a solid (or better) offensive line in 2023.

I like Braxton Jones at LT--at least, enough to keep trying him. Tevin Jenkins and Nate Davis are reasonable starters at guard. I'm not enamored with Cody Whitehair as C, but you can find a center later. To me, then, the position you can LEAST afford to get wrong in this draft is OT--specifically, RT.

So how do we fix this? Well, we need to get a tackle. Fortunately there are a lot of tackles to choose from. You might say, let's just go for the highest ranked one. But I think you can accomplish more if you trade down and take Wright. Here's why:

1. As said before, you still have other needs. Trading down helps you fill those other spots
2. I think Wright at RT is a stronger fit than any other OT at either side. Yeah, maybe Wright is not as good a LT prospect as Paris Johnson or Peter Skoronski. And yeah, LT is more valuable than RT. But I feel better about Wright's chances to start day 1 at RT than I do any OT to start at LT, and I feel good about Braxton Jones at LT. So I think Wright is the surest shot to getting to that solid OL.
3. That said, I'm not entirely sold that Wright is a lost cause at LT. I wouldn't start him there in 2023, no. But what I've read makes me think that he can still refine his technique. 3 or 4 years down the road, who knows?

So this is what I want. It will be hard because, of course A) "You need somebody to trade with"--the old adage is true, and B) Wright's draft position seems to be fluctuating wildly, and it could be hard to figure out how far back you can trade and still get him. But this would be the move that makes me feel best at the end of the night.

## Moves that would make me feel alright

### Pick Jaylen Carter at 9

After the season ended, I wanted to pick Carter at 1, possibly. I think he would be a perfect fit for the Bears and for what they need. And he could be a star. Getting him at 9? Sure, that's good.

Of course, there are issues. I'm not really concerned about his on-field issues. I think he still accomplished a lot even if he didn't play 100% all the time, I give DTs a bit of slack for taking plays off since they get mauled more than anyone, and I don't know if Ebeflus has ever said his "HITS" philosophy can't be taught. So I'm not worried about that.

I'm a little more worried about his off-field issues. Maybe I'm just a weirdo, but drag-racing just seems like a very poor decision. I'm getting a little less concerned about it as I hear more.

But that's my only concern. If the Bears take him at 9, that means they feel okay about it, and I'm willing to give them that benefit of the doubt at this point. And he's really useful, even if it means our OL has to wait for help. That's how good he is.

### Pick Paris Johnson or Darnell Wright at 9

I'm not going to be incredibly upset if either of these happen. After all, I'm laser focused on that OT position and this addresses it. But I think there's value at the OT position in the middle of the first round, and if this happens it means that the Bears weren't able to take advantage of it with a trade down (or there was a lot of OT drafted higher than 9, which seems unlikely).

It would be a fine and good move. But it wouldn't feel like a masterstroke.

## Moves that I would be nervous about but accept

### Pick Peter Skoronski at 9

I get it; he's technically amazing and has great feet. But it just seems like his arms are going to keep him from playing LT. And maybe RT, for that matter. Okay, you move him to guard. But for the Bears, what are you doing in 2023? You still have to kick someone outside, or find a tackle that's not on the roster yet. Also, and this is perhaps me being paranoid, but: I don't think we've seen Skoronski play guard yet, ever. Why is everyone so sure he's going to be a Pro Bowler there? I'm not saying I'm worried about it, I just think it's not a total lock that everyone seems to assume. At least, not enough that I want him over a purer tackle prospect like Paris Johnson.

### Pick some CB at 9

I get it; CB is a premium position and if you want a really good one, you typically find that in the top 15 picks. But I feel pretty good about the Bears CBs right now. I like Gordon, and you're committed to him for next year anyway. I like Jaylon Johnson, and unless you're not going to re-sign him--and there's no reason you shouldn't--I think those are a good pair. And I'm okay with 
Vildor and Jones as the third CBs.

If you're not going to re-sign Johnson, I could understand taking a CB to make sure you've got someone ready to step in. But otherwise, I don't see this as a high need. Could they benefit from more bodies? Sure, but that's what later rounds are for (and having an extra pick from trading down would help that).

Bottom line: If the Bears go into the 2023 season without adding to the CB group, I won't be worried. I can't say that about the OL or DL.

### Trade up to draft Jalen Carter

It might be necessary to move up to get Carter. And I would understand it. But this team is still full of holes. I don't think it's smart to whittle down their draft pool right now.

### Trade down to draft Bijan Robinson

Sigh...I get it. He's really talented. And I do think the Bears need another RB.

But it's a RB. In the first round.

You have other priorities.

## Moves that I would be annoyed by

### Draft Broderick Jones at any spot

I actually feel fine about him as a prospect, but the notion of the Bears having two OTs named Br Jones, after they added linebackers named T Edmunds and T Edwards...well it feels like Poles is trolling us.

## Moves that I would be confused about

### Basically anything else, except...

## Moves that I would be furious about

### Draft Bijan Robinson at 9

Come ON.

Alright, I'll talk about it. You are not going to re-sign Robinson to a second contract. It just isn't smart. So taking Robinson in the first round is not a long-term move. It's a short-term move. That's not where the Bears are.

And let's be clear, it's not like he's completely safe. Football Outsiders' Speed Score is meh on him (not bad, just not a special back). Most people don't seem to think he's better than Saquon, and did Saquon really turn the Giants into a special team? Mostly no; he was either injured, or he was trying to drag a less-talented team to the playoffs--a team that might have benefitted more from better players at more impactful positions.

This isn't 1988 and he's not Barry Sanders, folks

# How I feel about other rounds

If you could get another 2nd rounder, then you could maybe end up using the 2nd round to tackle C, DT, and DE, or some other useful position. Boy that would feel good, right?

I do think they need some skill position offensive players at some point, just because they need to have depth for 2023 and some folks who might step up if other players leave. But I'm okay with taking that later. I'm a little attached to RB Chase Brown from Illinois in one of the Day 3 rounds. But they definitely don't have any RBs who have proven they can catch the ball right now, and that's a problem.

# Final Thoughts

GO BEARS!!!

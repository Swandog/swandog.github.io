What's the best time to write your predictions and thoughts about the NFL season? Before Week 1 starts? Obviously not. After Week 1? Also wrong. No, in the grand tradition of this blog, I'm running past the deadline and actually writing this during the early slate of Week 1 games--all about in the 2nd quarter right now--like a total dumbass.

Nonetheless, this is me getting my thoughts and predictions about the 2023 season on the internet.

# Divisions

## AFC East

To be honest I'm not overly excited about any of these teams. I think Tua might just be too flawed to be That Guy in Miami. I'm not really enamored of the idea that guys who have been somewhere forever just move and they're still great (I know Tom Brady did it, but I think it doesn't usually work out like that), so I'm sort of skeptical of the Jets. The Bills just seem like they don't know how to get that last piece. And the Patriots...well, at least they're using actual offensive coordinators this year. That's not much but it's something.

So in general I'm not super confident in any of these teams; they all seem really good but also like they probably have a flaw. That seems like the kind of formula that produces a #3 seed who outplays their seed in the playoffs, and I could see that. I would probably pick the Bills if I had to but in general I'd rather stay away from this division.

## AFC South

Miss me on these "intriguing Texans and Colts" takes. They're both starting rookie QBs with minimal rosters, and tbh I was kind of down on this QB class in general. So sure, they may be worth watching, but I don't think they'll be good.

That leaves the Titans, who somehow always seem to be better than they should be, and the Jaguars, who should win this by default. I assume the Titans will look good but clearly not a threat; we'll see if they figure out how to move forward in the future. The only question, then, is how good the Jaguars could be. One of my beliefs here is that a player coming back from being out of the game for 2 years is not going to be great right off the bat; so far it's been 1 quarter and I already look stupid about that. If Ridley is really, really good, then this team is interesting. Probably not good enough on D to be a real threat, but a team that can't be taken lightly.

## AFC West

What I said about QBs (vis-a-vis Aaron Rodgers) also holds for coaches IMO. In other words, people are just asserting that Sean Payton is going to run a really good team right off the bat and I'm just not certain of that. It's not like the Saints were blowing the doors off people near the end of his tenure, and now he's moved somewhere else and only brought part of his supporting staff. Maybe it works but I'm not just writing that in ink. And that's before we get to any questions about whether Russell Wilson still has it or not. Long story short, I am **DOWN** on the Broncos this year.

God only knows what the Raiders are doing. At least when Al was in charge it was entertaining.

The Chiefs are just the Chiefs. The big question is whether they can continue to be the Chiefs if and when Travis Kelce leaves. Thursday's results indicate that they don't have it solved at the moment, but still "Patrick Mahomes throws to some chumps" is a better plan than half the league at least. It's too bad that Kadarius Toney is turning out to be completely useless; that could have set up a bridge to the future that would be really special. But these are offseason concerns; right now, they're still the team that won the Super Bowl in a so-called rebuilding year. At some point Kelce will be healthy and Chris Jones will show up, and we'll see if they can pull it off again.

Finally, the Chargers. The team I am endless skeptical of, and that's not changing now. Yes, I get that Justin Herbert is supremely talented. But honestly, I think that if he was the guy that all his boosters say he is, we wouldn't be waiting for them to do more. The tier that they want to put Herbert in cover up the flaws of the team; I think we just have to admit that Herbert has not done that, at least not yet. My guess is that this team will underperform, and Staley will get fired. And maybe that's what Herbert needs; the best plan is to probably keep removing parts until you figure out what is holding Justin back.

## AFC North

I like the Steelers; they just have a lot of qualities that please me aesthetically. I feel good about them this year, but right now they are getting STOMPED by the 49ers. I'm still saying they'll be good but let's see if I'm instantly wrong.

I like the Ravens; they also appeal to me aesthetically. It would be nice to see Lamar get back to being a force of nature and this team being a real offensive juggernaut. It's kind of weird that Greg Roman has been unable to get past his ceiling at every stop, but you can't argue that it wasn't time to go.

I like the Bengals; they are very good, Joe Burrow is just a lot of fun, and they have already accomplished a lot. I seem to remember a lot of people saying they were stupid for not throwing away Zac Taylor after his first season, and I like that they didn't and moved forward instead of starting over. I think they'll be very good again.

I hate the Browns. I didn't like how people fetishized their process and insisted that it was making good teams even when the results were bad. I mean, *I* agree that you judge process over results, but you can't just continue to argue that the results don't matter. They have been a bad team for several years! And all of this made me annoyed by the Browns, and then they went and pissed me off even more by getting Watson. I hope they lose every game. I *think* they won't make the playoffs.

## NFC East

The Eagles and Cowboys should both be good and easy playoff teams. I would lean towards the Eagles taking the division but it could go either way. However, I still feel that Mike McCarthy doesn't know what he's doing and he's gonna kneecap this team in the playoffs. Who knows if Jerry Jones can ever get out of his way enough to get this team to be a true contender before Dak starts to decline.

I'm sort of rooting for the Washington team. First, I like that Dan Snyder is gone. And I want Eric Bieniemy to succeed. And I think they have a lot of talent that people just forget about. They just have some real flaws/questions that are obvious to everyone, which is why nobody is sticking their neck out for this team. I get it. But if they can get the QBs to average, I think this can be a decent team, and I want to see it.

The Giants...look, I've never thought much of Daniel Jones. I think *very* highly of Brian Daboll, though. I don't think he's going to make Jones into the next Josh Allen but maybe he can figure out how to make this work. I'm pessimistic, though.

## NFC South

It seems like everyone is boosting the Falcons. I'm skpetical; I just don't think they're gonna be that good. However, they might be good enough to win this division. I think the only real competition is the Saints, and even that is just a team with a hopefully solid floor, not a high celing. But I wouldn't put much hope in any team coming out of this division.

The Bucs and Panthers are obviosly gonna be bad. As a Bears fan I'm hoping the Panthers are *especially* bad, of course.

## NFC West

I would hope that the Trey Lance saga would end the call of "you gotta have an alien at QB and you must sacrifice all parts of your team until you get one" mantra but I'm assuming it won't. I know that it's hard to build a championship team without a great QB, but you know what else is hard? Finding a great QB! So I applaud the 49ers for just continuing to win without worrying about whether they have a future Hall of Famer on a rookie contract at QB. How they build this team in the future will be fascinating, but for now they should be very good. I'm expecting them to be a real threat to win the NFC.

I really like the Seahawks, but it seems like they might not get the breaks they need. It would be unfortunate if that was the case; this is a fun team. I think they'll be good but they might just not make the level of contender this year.

The Cardinals are obviously bad, and the Rams are probably bad too.

## NFC North

Well I obviously structured this to make my team's division end up last. So what do I think about this division? I don't know. I know it's extremely anti-intellectual, but I can't get over the fact that the Lions are The Lions until proven otherwise. I only caught half the game on Thursday, but they seemed both impressive and yet maybe still flawed. Whatever you want to call it, I've watched this division my entire life and I can't shake the feeling that they're not going to be a real contender in the NFC. They might win the division, though.

The Vikings are interesting. I can't understand why they didn't get Trey Lance but that's another issue. They clearly weren't as good as their record last year but who knows if they will reinforce the structure before it collapses. They seem like they should be competent, and maybe that's enough for this year. We'll see if they can come up with a theory of how they will be a dominant team in the years to come.

The Packers seem like one of the teams with the largest possible variance. Love could be decent, the offense could be good, and the defense could finally live up to its talent. Or maybe all of those bets fail! In the former, this team could be a stealth NFC contender, in the latter this team is looking at a top 10 pick or higher. I kind of think that they'll be okay but not great, and probably have a losing record.

### Chicago Bears

That comes to my Bears. I'm already nervous about the offensive line; it's the one place I really wanted them to fix this offseason (after the DJ Moore trade), and they kind of did, but they did rely on a lot of guys returning who weren't that great anyway. And now those guys seem to be falling apart, and the plan is starting to look bad. I get the idea of focusing on an area and hammering it to make sure it's solid; I just wish they had done that with the interior OL rather than the DT or CB spots. But it still might work out.

Meanwhile, it's hard to say where Justin Fields is at. He seems better than last year, but maybe not good enough? The preseason just didn't give much evidence of how good he is right now. I think he'll obviously be improved, but I'm worried that he won't be so good that you'll be ready to commit or dump him this offseason, and that's really what they need to know. Still hoping, but I've been burned before.

I do like the defense. There's a problem with the pass rush which will stop it from really being good, but that was known. They still need another offseason to turn this into a strength, but I feel optimistic that it's gonna get there.

Honestly, if the Bears get to 7 wins this year, that's good enough for me. The only other thing I would want is a clear direction on Justin.

### NFC North prediction

So who am I predicting to win the North? I don't know. I kind of feel like the Bears are going to finish in third; one of the other 3 teams is gonna collapse (probably not the Lions but who knows), but they won't finish higher. That is, I'm saying that the Bears the worst team, but won't finish with the worst record; just a hunch. I think I would take the Lions to win this division, but not with a strong record; 10-7 seems right.

# Conclusion

So those are my thoughts. I'll try to keep writing nonsense throught the season, but at least I can put my bad takes up for posterity.
